## Methodology

### 1. Data Understanding & Cleaning
- Load MRI metadata  
- Check missing values  
- Understand distributions  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize cognitive status groups  
- Analyze MRI-based features  
- Identify early biomarkers  

### 3. Preprocessing
- Normalize features  
- Handle class imbalance  
- Extract meaningful predictors  

### 4. Modeling
- Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)  
- Tune hyperparameters  
- Compare model performance  

### 5. Evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Feature importance analysis
